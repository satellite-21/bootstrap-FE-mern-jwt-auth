## React JWT Authentication (without Redux) example

In this tutorial, we’re gonna build a React JWT Authentication example with LocalStorage, React Router, Axios and Bootstrap (without Redux). I will show you:

- JWT Authentication Flow for User Signup & User Login
- Project Structure for React JWT Authentication (without Redux) with LocalStorage, React Router & Axios
- Creating React Components with Form Validation
- React Components for accessing protected Resources (Authorization)
- Dynamic Navigation Bar in React App

## User Registration and User Login Flow
For JWT Authentication, we’re gonna call 2 endpoints:

- POST `api/auth/signup` for User Registration
- POST `api/auth/signin` for User Login

The following flow shows you an overview of Requests and Responses that React Client will make or receive. This React Client must add a JWT to HTTP Header before sending request to protected resources.

or

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
